# Week_10A_Task
This repository contains the task for Week 10A.

# Initial tasks:
- In this task you will have to upgrade your Movie and Person handler application, using abstract classes, interfaces and inheritance.
Your task is to extend your application to be able to calculate prices and investments of buyable products.
- People can rent any type of products, but can buy only movies and games: books are only rentable.
- Every product has an identifier which is generated by the application itself.
- Person means NOT ONLY actresses/actors in this version, so it is strongly needed to be your application modified.

# Problems fixed after the demo:
- The class "Product" was not abstract.
- The "IdGenerator.generate()" method didn't return with a unique id.
- The id was generated after creating the object.
- The Games class' "getPrice()" method extracted the price by -20% each time it was called.
- Remowed unnecessary print(s) and simplified some methods.
